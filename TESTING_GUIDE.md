## 🐛 If You Find Issues

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

**Issue**: Docker containers won't start
```bash
# Run cleanup script
.\docker-cleanup.ps1  # Windows
./docker-cleanup.sh   # Linux/Mac

# Rebuild
docker compose up --build
```

**Issue**: Links not working
- Check if you're using real compound names (Aspirin, Caffeine, etc.)
- For PDB, use 4-character IDs (1CRN, 3HFM, etc.)
- Check browser console for errors

**Issue**: Slow responses
- Check internet connection
- Verify APIs are accessible
- Check Docker logs: `docker compose logs backend`

**Issue**: TL;DR not showing
- Scroll to end of response
- Check browser supports CSS gradients
- Try Ctrl+F5 to clear cache
