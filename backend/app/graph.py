**Research Context:**
{context_summary}{compound_summary}

**Research Query:** {text}

**Instructions:**
Please generate a specific, testable hypothesis with the following structure and formatting:

## Main Hypothesis
- **Bold** the primary hypothesis statement
- Use clear, scientific language
- Include specific predictions

## Scientific Rationale
- Use bullet points (•) for supporting evidence
- **Bold** key molecular mechanisms
- Include relevant pathways and targets

## Proposed Experimental Approach
- Use numbered lists (1., 2., 3.) for experimental steps
- **Bold** key techniques and methods
- Include controls and validation approaches

## Expected Outcomes
- Use bullet points for predicted results
- **Bold** therapeutic implications
- Include potential clinical applications

## Potential Challenges
- Use bullet points for limitations
- **Bold** important considerations
- Include mitigation strategies

**Formatting Requirements:**
- Use ## for main headings
- Use ### for subheadings
- Use **bold** for important terms, hypotheses, and concepts
- Use bullet points (•) for lists
- Use numbered lists (1., 2., 3.) for sequences
- Include proper spacing between sections
- Make the response visually appealing and professional

CRITICAL: You MUST end your response with a "**TL;DR:**" section (in bold) that provides a concise 2-3 sentence summary of the hypothesis and its key implications.
