Please generate a specific, testable hypothesis that:
1. Is based on the provided literature context
2. Incorporates relevant molecular mechanisms
3. Suggests potential therapeutic targets or interventions
4. Is scientifically sound and testable
5. Includes specific proteins, pathways, or compounds when relevant

Format your response as a clear, concise hypothesis statement followed by a brief rationale.

CRITICAL: You MUST end your response with a "TL;DR" section that provides a concise 2-3 sentence summary of the hypothesis and its key implications.
